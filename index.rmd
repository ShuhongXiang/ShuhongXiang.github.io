# About the dashboard on the top left!

I often go to NYC for finding some good restaurants in NYC. So I really care about the inspection results in NYC. Based on the NYC inspection dataset, the analysis on the Korean restaurant (my favorite food) has been put there. You can also click the link here to see the graphs: [Dashboard](dashboard.html)

# Thanks for reaching me !
