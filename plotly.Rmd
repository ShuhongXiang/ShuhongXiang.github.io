I want to know about the Korean restaurant' circumstance in NYC so I choose to analyze the NYC Restaurant Inspection Results dataset from the p8105.datasets.  

```{r , include=FALSE}
 data("rest_inspec") 
```

```{r}
korean_rest = 
  rest_inspec %>%
  select(boro, cuisine_description, critical_flag, score, grade, zipcode, inspection_date) %>%
  filter (cuisine_description == "Korean") %>%
  mutate(cuisine_description = as_factor(cuisine_description)) %>%
  mutate(critical_flag = as_factor(critical_flag)) %>%
  mutate(inspection_date = as_date(inspection_date))
korean_rest
```
